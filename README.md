**Next Level Fitness Tracker**

➪ **Introduction**

In today&#39;s market it is imperative that everyone do their part and remain healthy for the fight against not only covid-19, but all the other various diseases that plague the American people. The name will represent the next step in people&#39;s lives that choose to take themselves to the next level. It is a brand that will give people of all walks of life an identity and want to be a part of a movement.

The Next Level Fitness Tracker (will be a web application) that will help its user&#39;s track important parts of their fitness journey. Most applications ask similar parts of information but feel that it&#39;s too much. This application will cover the very simple pieces of information that really matter when exercising. The goal of the application will be to easily organize their data, be efficient in delivering that information with our interface and give a representation of their progression. The application will track all data that is entered and give recommendations based on data.

**Application Helper**

There will be an option to register and the application will send an email to the user that will allow them to create their profile.

The very beginning will login asking basic questions that need to be addressed and tracked for providing an overall important question of how healthy you are and your exercising, which is encompassing of this profile. The user will be able to update this information when certain habits change as well.

- Overall consider yourself with health: Great, good, okay, bad, or poor
- How often do you work out?
- Questions about eating habits: how often you eat, are you fasting, water consumption.
- How consistent do you sleep, and for how long usually?

Next the application will compile a menu based off the information provided in the beginning. This menu will serve as a foundation to build upon for all users. There will be several spaces that need to be filled out for example you workout three times a week. The user will need to enter what was worked out that day, if it was a specific muscle group, or multiple muscle groups. Based off this for example if the user did chest the website will generate a new blank space asking for max weight when chest pressing for that given day. The website will track the big three workouts such as chest pressing, deadlift and squat exercises to track improvement overtime. The application will ask for the calories burned during those exercises as well and there will be a blank space at the bottom for that. Next will ask if you completed cardio with the workout and a blank space to enter that information. After that the application will ask about how many calories were consumed over the course of the day, based on the meals the user entered at the beginning.

All this information will be factored into code and will generate either a calorie surplus or deficit, which will be geared towards the user&#39;s goals that will be entered at the beginning when creating their profile but can be edited as well. Sleep will also have a location at the bottom to represent how much sleep was accomplished during that given day. This will be entered for everyday and will use multiple tables of data to compare over the days, weeks, months, and years.

This information will be stored on a database that can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world.

➪ **Results**

**Proven track record overtime**

As a user fills out daily information more and more data will be stored to paint an accurate picture of what is happening on a day-to-day basis. Once enough data is compiled the application will let the user know overall how many calories the user burned over the course of days, weeks, months, and years. Will even give recommendations based on information where there is room for improvement. By using this application, it will give users a place to document their progress overall.
